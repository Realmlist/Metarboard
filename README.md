# Metarboard
Tool that grabs METAR information, formats it, and displays it on a Vestaboard.

I'm using this project to learn Python, don't expect professional-grade programming.


## Installation & usage
See [`install.sh`](https://github.com/Realmlist/Metarboard/blob/main/install.sh) for installation instructions.

Don't forget to edit the generated `.secrets.toml` file.
